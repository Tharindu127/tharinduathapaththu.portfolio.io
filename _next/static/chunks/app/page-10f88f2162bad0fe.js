The system combines computer vision technology with educational analytics to provide instructors with real-time insights into student participation and attention during online lectures.\nThe technical implementation consists of two interconnected components: a Windows desktop application built with Python, and a web-based dashboard developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS. The Windows application utilizes computer vision libraries to capture and analyze facial expressions, eye movements, and posture indicators through the student's webcam during virtual classes. This data is processed locally to identify engagement patterns such as attention focus, confusion signals, and participation readiness.\nPrivacy considerations were paramount in the design, with all facial analysis processing occurring locally on the student's device. Only aggregated engagement metrics are transmitted to the central system, rather than raw video data or images. Students maintain control over when monitoring is active, and clear visual indicators show when the system is operational.\nThe web interface provides instructors with both real-time and historical analytics on class engagement. The dashboard visualizes attention patterns throughout lecture sessions, identifying potential learning gaps when engagement consistently drops during specific topics. Instructors can view both class-wide trends and anonymized individual participation metrics to identify students who might need additional support.\nThe research component of this project involved extensive data collection and analysis of virtual classroom interaction patterns. This research identified key factors contributing to reduced student-teacher interaction in video conferencing environments, including technical limitations, psychological barriers, and instructional design challenges. The findings were published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings, contributing to the growing body of knowledge on effective distance education methodologies.\nA significant innovation in ActiveMeet is its adaptive feedback system that provides subtle prompts to both instructors and students. When the system detects declining engagement across multiple participants, it can suggest to the instructor that a change of pace or interactive element might be beneficial. Similarly, students showing extended periods of inattention can receive gentle reminders to refocus on the lecture material.\nThe technical architecture employs a client-server model with the Python application serving as the client-side processor for facial analysis. This component utilizes machine learning models trained on classroom engagement datasets to accurately identify attention states specific to learning environments. The web server, built on a PHP backend with MySQL database integration, handles data aggregation, user authentication, and analytics visualization.\nThe development process included multiple rounds of user testing with both students and instructors, refining the system based on feedback regarding accuracy, usability, and perceived value. This iterative approach led to significant improvements in the user interface design and the refinement of engagement detection algorithms.\nThe ActiveMeet project demonstrates the potential for thoughtful application of computer vision technology to enhance educational outcomes in distance learning scenarios, while carefully balancing monitoring capabilities with privacy considerations and
